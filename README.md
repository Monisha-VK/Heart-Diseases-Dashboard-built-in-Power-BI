# 🫀 Heart Diseases Dashboard

This project presents an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that visualizes and analyzes heart disease data. The dashboard helps users explore key health parameters, uncover trends, and identify risk factors associated with heart disease through data-driven insights.

---

## 📊 Overview
The **Heart Diseases Dashboard** provides a comprehensive view of patient data such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, glucose level, and other health metrics.  
It helps healthcare analysts and researchers monitor patterns, compare demographics, and predict potential heart-related risks.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To analyze patient health data for heart disease risk.
- To visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) such as cholesterol, blood pressure, and age distribution.
- To provide insights into correlations between risk factors and heart disease outcomes.
